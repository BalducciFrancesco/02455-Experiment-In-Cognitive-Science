Participant ID;Date;Sensor ID;Start time (firstbeat);End time (firstbeat);Notes on post-hoc converstation regarding the belief
1;12-nov-25;11;14:44;14:58;Did not feel like videos were AI-generated while watching, felt more focused when watching presumed AI-videos in order to spot whether it was AI.
2;12-nov-25;11;15:06;15:18;Was trying w=to figure out if it was AI or not, Didnt know if the real videos were actually AI
3;12-nov-25;11;15:27;15:41;Speculated if videos were either all AI or all human, did not believe labels
4;12-nov-25;11;15:47;16:04;Believed labels, were only a bit sceptical, squirrel looked like AI
5;13-nov-25;11;13:26;13:42;Was a bit sceptical with some of the videos. Didnt believe otters were AI or squirrel was real
6;13-nov-25;11;13:52;14:09;Believed all the labels
7;13-nov-25;12;13:50;14:09;All videos felt real, although them being slowed down was an hint of AI
8;13-nov-25;12;15:21;15:32;She found it intriguing but expected the procedure as she did a similar experiment for a PhD. She believed all the labels except for one.
9;13-nov-25;12;15:56;16:08;REMOVED – Fascinated as personally into heartrate and AI. More focused on videos with AI cue to check if it was true. Bored with the otters and happy with the dogs. He wouldn't have been able to distinguish the real and the AI if not for the label.
10;13-nov-25;12;16:28;16:41;Focused on verifying if the ones labeled AI were real only at the very last video, where he still believed to the label (AI). 
11;14-nov-25;11;15:38;16:01;Didn't completely believe all the labels, though maybe ants were AI when it said human etc.
12;15-nov-25;11;09:46;10:02;Believed what we said about the labels, but thought some of the labels didnt seem like they matched
13;15-nov-25;11;10:15;10:32;Didn't believe the labels, didn't believe that the videos that said AI-generated was actually AI-generated
14;16-nov-25;12;16:03;16:17;Video felt a bit too long and distracting. They were cute. Dind't focus too on proving if they were lied, but the ants video seemed not AI at all.
15;17-nov-25;11;14:29;14:49;Thought that either all videos were AI or all videos were Human
16;19-nov-25;11;13:38;13:52;Was sceptical about videos labels, some said human but thought they were AI
17;19-nov-25;11;14:02;14:16;Did not really believe the labels, lignede kun AI videoer
18;19-nov-25;11;14:25;14:41;Thought human videos were slow paced, and AI was fast paced, didn't believe labels for all videos
19;19-nov-25;11;14:58;15:14;Didnt believe the labels that much, felt like labels were switched
20;19-nov-25;11;15:26;15:40;Felt like some labels were not human generated, could not differentiate nature of videos, believed it when said was AI generated
21;19-nov-25;11;15:50;16:03;Believed labels in some cases, but didnt with others
22;19-nov-25;11;16:26;16:41;Believed most of the labels
23;26-nov-25;11;14:57;15:12;Felt like the videos were relaxing, he liked it. About the labels, they felt inverted. Overall focused on the videos content.
24;26-nov-25;11;15:24;15:37;REMOVED – Felt like the labels were swapped. At the beginning was trying to prove this, then focused on the content.
